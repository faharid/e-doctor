# eDoctor

Frontend repository for my MEAN Stack web app called eDoctor. eDoctor lets patients make doctor's appointments in easy way and the doctor's module helps to schedule visits and manage them in one place.

live version of this app is available on: `https://blooming-sea-55548.herokuapp.com/`.

The app is still under development, so you may see some improvements here and there in time.

## Patient module

Register as a Patient and you will have a possibility to make an appointment request with doctor of your choice. The doctor can either accept or decline your request - you will see the outcome in the Notifications section under a small bell icon. Every visit will be available for you on your sidebar. After a completed visit you can rate your doctor, and your rate will affect the doctor's global rate.

## Doctor's module

Register as a Doctor and your profile will be available for patients to make a request appointment. You will see every request in your Notification section. Every accepted or declined request will be visible for you on your dashboard calendar. From there, you can conduct accepted visits. You will be presented with patient's previous medical history (if available) and the Exam form with basic elements crucial for every visit. You can always edit an already conducted visit.
